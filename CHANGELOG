Date        Version Note

19/01/2011  0.2.2   Nothing new but I've add a Makefile to make compiling easier
                    and more efficient. Now unused dependencies like gtk are no
                    more needed (Finch users should be happy!)

29/10/2010  0.2.1   Added a timestamp and some other info to popup alert (thanks
                    to Bharath Rajaram)
                    
28/10/2010  0.2     Iâ€™ve fixed a bug about status recheck. That probably was the
                    major cause of unreliability
                    
14/10/2010	0.1.2   Added a recheck of buddy status after a timeout (default 
                    10s) to avoid/reduce false positives due to network errors
                    
22/07/2010  0.1.1   Popup are now optionals. Added alerts in conversations and 
                    system log
                    
16/07/2010  0.1     First
