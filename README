Google Invisibility Tracker

Description:
This plugin informs you when a buddy of yours goes invisible. This is possible 
only if your buddy uses Gmail chat or Google Talk Lab Edition or iGoogle chat.

How? Why?

The reason is that these 3 clients use to send a vcard node when they go offline
while when going invisible they send a plain unavailable presence. This means 
that if we analyze all unavailable presences sent by online buddies we can 
discover if they’re going offline or invisible. Obviously you have to be online
(or at least invisible) to catch the presence.

Note that there’s a odd case: if shared status is invisible we cannot state if
the chat is turned on while if shares status is not invisible we’re sure that an
unavailable presence (with the vcard) means that the buddy has the chat turned 
off (in that client/resource obviously!).

There is an easy way to cheat this plugin: just use a XMPP client without Google
Shared Status (i.e. Pidgin, Psi, Kopete) and set the resource to “gmail” or 
“iGoogle” or “TalkGadget” and after login go offline. The client will send a 
presence unavailable without vcard so the plugin will catch you as Invisible.


NOTE:

o - I’ve not tested this idea very much so if you think there’s something wrong 
    please make me know! I know for sure there’re some false positives. If you 
    had experience of this please send me as details as possible. Thanks!

o - This plugin works only with Gmail address with domain gmail.com. I know that
    I could use Google Talk flag to get all Gmail accounts but this is not 
    possible in Debian by using only pidgin-dev dependencies. If you know a 
    better way to do this please contact me!
    
o - Because my friend Alessandro complained that a popup every time a buddy goes
    invisible is quite annoying (and he’s definitively right! :) ), I’ve made it
    optional. Now you can be informed in several ways:
      - Debug window: the most verbose and always enabled;
      - Popup: old annoying method;
      - Conversations Message: a message appears in all conversations windows;
      - System Log: a message is written in system log;

*** Popup, Conversations Message and System Log are disabled by default, this 
means you have to enable them in configurations! ***

How to install:
Read the INSTALL file.

How to use:
1)  Compile and Install (read INSTALL) or Download (from 
    http://www.siorarina.net/google-invisibility-tracker/) the plugin for your 
    arch.

    Linux: if you don't have GNU make program installed on your system, to 
    install the plugin manually copy google-invisibility-tracker.so in your 
    purple home dir:
    
    (if ~/.purple/plugins/ does not exist: $ mkdir ~/.purple/plugins/ )
    $ cp google-invisibility-tracker.so ~/.purple/plugins/

    Windows: Move google-invisibility-tracker.dll in Pidgin plugins dir (I 
    suppose you can create 
    C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Applications data\.purple\plugins 
    and move the plugin there). In Windows it should be something like 
    C:\Programmi\Pidgin\plugins\

3)  Restart Pidgin and in Tools/Plugins you should see Google Invisibility Tracker

    Once enabled you’ll be notified every time a buddy of yours goes invisible. 
    Popup, Conversations Message and System Log are disabled by default, this 
    means you have to enable them in configurations.
